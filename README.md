# Shouse-Live
Welcome to the initial concept of the shouse monitoring system that will be developed to provide full security to the entire property.

Building from scratch, the Shouse Live Monitor will slowly but surely be developed with the future prospect of production nto a product for resale. This monitor will serve as a web-based monitor using mutliple technologies to retrieve and transmit sensor and real time data.

# In the Beginning:
The very first steps are to set up and explore the idea. The idea comes froma way to monitor water levels in a tank that I use for rain capture.

This would utilize a simple flaoting sensor that completes or disconnects a curcuit, triggering a microcontroller to send the new status to a server that can display the results and be accessed by a web browser. 

# First Commit
This concludes the first commit in the readme. This will be updated in the developer log with a similar entry. The rest of this file will be dedicated to the readme.
